# 100 Light Bulbs
## Prompt

There is a group of a 100 people in a line (all numbered 1-100) and a room filled with 100 lightbulbs (all numbered 1-100) all of which are currently off. When a person walks into the light bulb room, they would flip the switch for lightbulbs that their number is a factor of. If every person was to do this then how many lightbulbs would be left on after all 100 people were to walk through the room?

Please write a function to find this answer given a single number input of N=100

Can you write a functio0n that solves this faster than linear time?

Example to give
```
Person #25 would flip the switch for lightbulbs 25, 50, 75, 100.

```
