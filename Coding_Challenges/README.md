# Coding Challenges


These are examples coding challenges one could potentially recieve during the interview process.The prompt for each Coding Challenge will be in the README.md file of each folder. 

Notes and general soltuion outline will be listed in the SOLUTION.md file and an example code solution will be available in the SOLUTION.js file or SOLUTION Folder. Some of these prompts may not have actual solution code as the challenge will be general enough where there are multiple correct solutions.
