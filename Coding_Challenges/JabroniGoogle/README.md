# Jabroni Google

## Prompt

Create an application (CLI or GUI) that prompts the user for a text string, performs a Web search (Google(deprecated)/Yahoo(deprecated)/Bing/other - your choice) and returns the title and URL of the first result. Use any tools / libraries you wish, but you must provide instructions on how to build and run your application(README.md file). Include a brief description of your application, why you implemented it the way you did, and any optomizations you did.
